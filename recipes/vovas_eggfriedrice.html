    <h2>Vova's Delicious Egg Fried Rice</h2>
    <p>This, ladies and gentlemen, is definitely not Askar's Shakshuka, but it can compete with it on a scale of deliciousness.<br> This recipe is meant for students who are a bit too lazy to cook proper meals.<br>So, if you're a student who has no idea how to cook, this recipe is perfect for you.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g of boiled rice (preferrably cold)</li>
        <li>4-5 eggs</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Sunflower oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps for the creation of Vova's Egg Fried Rice</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put your pan on medium heat and pour some sunflower oil. Spread it across the whole pan.<br>This is done in order for your cooking not to stick to the pan, so cleaning it will be much easier.</li>
        <li>Drop your boiled rice onto the pan, spread it out a bit with a spatula.</li>
        <li>While the rice is there, whisk your eggs in a bowl and once you're done, this should be the perfect spread it across your rice.</li>
        <li>Occasionally mix in order for the eggs and rice to fry equally.</li>
        <li>After a couple minutes of mixing, add about two tablespoons of soy sauce. However, if you add to much, the meal will turn out to be too salty.</li>
        <li>Cover the lid and wait for your masterpiece to be done.</li>
    </ol>
