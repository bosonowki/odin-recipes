    <div class="title"><h2>The World-Famous French Macaron</h2></div>
    <p>The French macaron that you're about to create is an extremely delicate and colorful (pink, in this case) confection that doesn't require extraordinary culinary skills for you to bake.</p>
    <div class="title"><h3>Ingredients</h3></div>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of almond flour</li>
        <li>3 white eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>3 drops of food coloring</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of vanilla</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of superfine sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="title"><h3>Steps for the creation of your delicious French Macaron</h3></div>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 320 degrees. Whisk confectioners' and almond flour.</li>
        <li>Sift the sugar-almond flour mixture, little by little, through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing with a rubber spatula to pass through as much as possible</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs whites, cream of tartar and your pinch of salt until frothy. (You can use a mixer or a whisker). Gradually add superfine sugar and beat until stiff and shiny.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg whites into the bowl with almond flour.</li>
        <li>Add food coloring, please add pink because you <strong>CLEARLY</strong> came here for pink macarons, right?</li>
        <li>Shove that boy into the oven and pray that everything will bake fine and you won't set your house on fire, because it turns out that the author of this website forgot the neccessary steps. I deeply apologize.</li>
        <li>Take that boy out of the oven and let it sit for a bit at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Enjoy glancing at your monstrosity because I'm not sure if it turned out fine or not. <em>Again, I apologize for wasting your dear time.</em></li>
    </ol>
