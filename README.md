# odin-recipes
In this little project, I will be able to create a fully-readable and understandable website that'll show a simple recipe.
I will use code and elements that I've previously learned on the odin project such as: creating titles, bodies, headers, paragraphs, lists that'll include bold and italic text.
Besides that, I will also include links that the user can open in a new browser window with required security elements, as well as images with alternative text and height and width elements.
I wish myself luck for this first project!
